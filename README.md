### Introduction

Credit card fraud is a serious issue, with reports increasing significantly every year. In the United States, credit card fraud reports rose by 44.7% from 271,927 cases in 2019 to 393,207 in 2020[citation:2]. This project aims to provide an effective solution using machine learning to help detect fraudulent transactions and reduce their impact.

### Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing the dataset to understand patterns and correlations.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Model Selection

The following machine learning models are used in this project:

1. **Logistic Regression:** Known for its simplicity and efficiency in binary classification problems.
2. **Decision Trees:** Provides an intuitive model by splitting the dataset based on feature importance.
3. **Neural Networks:** Advanced model capable of capturing complex patterns in large datasets.

### Data

The dataset used in this project consists of anonymized credit card transactions that include both fraudulent and non-fraudulent cases. The data preprocessing steps ensure the dataset is clean and ready for model training.
